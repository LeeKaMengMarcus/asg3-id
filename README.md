# Your Project's Name
The name of the project is Mahjii, this project waas created to help people understand the beauty of japanese mahjong

## Design Process
 
- The design of the website is to make it look as japanese style as possible, with cherry blossom. this project mainly focuses on people who does not know how to play mahjong and waants to give it a try, or for people who knows the basics of mahjong to play this variation of mahjong. in order to do so, i provided most of the basic rules of riichi and provided a quiz to see if they actually gets it.

- As a user, I want to read through the basics and rules from this website to get the gist of riichi
- As a user type, I would like to do the quiz, in order to test out if i have the knowledge to play riichi

This section is also where you would share links to any wireframes, mockups, diagrams etc. that you created as part of the design process. 
These files should themselves either be included as a pdf file in the project itself (in an separate directory)
Include the Adobe XD wireframe as a folder. You can include the XD share url.
